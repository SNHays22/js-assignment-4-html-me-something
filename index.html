            <p class="funParagraph">I was born and raised in St. Charles, MO, but my parents owned a farm in Lebanon, MO that we would visit often too. This is where my love for anilmals started. I grew up dreaming of having a job where I would spend my days with animals. There was a short period of time where I thought I could be a vet, but that didn't last long since I knew I wouldn't be able to euthanize any animal. My all time dream job, though, was to work specifically with dolphins &#128044; ; which is kind of a crazy idea for a kid from Missouri. </p>

            <h2>My High School & College Years</h2>

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In high school, my plan was still to pursue my dream of working with dolphins and my parents supported me in everyway they could. I had spoken to dolphin trainers several times throughout the years and learned that the best degree to get would be a psychology degree, since training dolphins deals with knowing how their minds work. My original plan was to major in Psychology and minor in Biology and Music. However, me and Biology did not get along, so I switched to minoring in Business and Music.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="funParagraph">While my parents never tried to convince me to choose a different career path, my last year of college, my dad started talking to me about having another option and getting my masters right away. He felt that if I didn't work towards my masters right away then I would not want to go back to school later. Little did he know how much I enjoy learning. After much thought, I agreed with him for a couple different reasons:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Over the years, I watched my older brother try to go back to finish college multiple times and never made it through one semester</li>
               <li>I knew my dad just wanted me to succeed</li>
               <li>I had started growing more fond of Criminology, especially since all I watched was "Law & Order: SVU" and "Criminal Minds"</li>
               <li>I was realistic with knowing that finding a job working with dolphins was not going to be easy</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="funParagraph">So, upon graduating with my bachelors, I applied for online classes to get a masters in Criminology. And, I am so glad I did. I learned so much and it got me even more interested in the criminal justice system. While working towards my masters, I continued to work with animals, and was even able to land an internship in Florida working with rescue dolphins at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.</p>

            <h2>My After College Phase</h2>

            <p class="funParagraph">I am happy to say I managaed to complete my masters program all online and still got the chance to walk in graduation. Unfortunately, during my time working towards my masters, my dad passed away unexpectedly. So, my new husband and I moved to be closer to my mom and my dream of working with dolphins was put on hold. During this time, I did a lot of customer service work. A couple years later, I jumped on the chance to assist my mom in opening a trucking company and helped with paperwork and payroll. Then, once I had my first child, I took a step back and realized that I needed to find a job where I actually enjoyed the work I was doing and not just the people I was working with. One of my friends recommended I look into coding. After that I was hooked, I completed an online, out-of-state, bootcamp, but had a hard time finding a job upon completion.</p>

            <p class="funParagraph">I was very lucky to find someone in my neighborhood that was looking for someone to help with office work for his security installing company. He was very impressed with my background and, in my words, random knowledge. After I started working for him, he added some webpage management to my job description. He also taught me the basic technical knowledge of our equipment and systems so that I could assist with troubleshooting remotely and be like the technical support contact.</p>

            <h2>My Current Position</h2>

            <p class="funParagraph">While I am still employed at the security company, the business has changed hands and the atmosphere is different. Working for this company has made me miss coding and has grown my interest in cybersecurity. I have so many questions about how the code looks on the backend to get these security systems working, and I just want to be coding. Then last year I saw an ad for LaunchCode and could not have been more excited. I spoke with my husband right away to make sure our schedules would allow me to make the time commitment and submitted my application. I knew space was limited in the courses, so when I got the email saying I was accepted into the course, I was bouncing off the walls. I am so excited to start this next chapter in my career. I enjoy being creative, making things work, and solving problems. I only wish I would have known about this when I first started college because this would have been the perfect path for me to take.</p>
